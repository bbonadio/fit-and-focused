<h1>Thank you for installing ADDONSTUFF!</h1>

<p>
	The addon works as follows. Every time you load an unproductive website (facebook etc.), 
	a popup will show you an exercise to make before allowing you on the page.
</p>

<p>
	In the next page, you will be able to choose the websites you want to block from a list, 
	but you can always add more easily while you are browsing by clicking on the addon logo.
</p>
<p>
	You can also choose the length of an exercise session and the time during which the access
	is granted after completing a workout.
