	<p>
		The addon works as follows. Every time you load an unproductive website (facebook etc.), 
		a popup will show you an exercise to make before allowing you on the page.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In the next page, you will be able to choose the websites you want to block from a list, 
		but you can always add more easily while you are browsing by clicking on the addon logo.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also choose the length of an exercise session and the time during which the access
		is granted after completing a workout.
